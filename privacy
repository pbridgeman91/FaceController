Privacy Policy
Last Updated: February 19, 2026
FaceController (“we,” “our,” or “the App”) is built with a privacy-first architecture. We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data. All processing occurs locally on your device.

1. Face Data and TrueDepth Camera Usage
FaceController utilizes Apple’s TrueDepth camera and ARKit to detect head movements and facial gestures, allowing you to control gameplay. To comply with Apple’s privacy requirements, we explicitly state the following:
* What is used: The App accesses depth and facial tracking data provided by the TrueDepth camera.
* How it is used: This information is processed in real-time to convert your movements and expressions into input controls (e.g., aiming, clicking, or triggering actions).
* On-device processing: All face tracking and depth processing occurs locally on your device.
* No storage: We do not record, capture, save, or store face data, depth data, facial geometry, images, or video.
Face data never leaves your device. We do not share face data with any third parties, analytics providers, external servers, or advertising platforms.

2. Data Collection
FaceController does not collect any personal data. To ensure your total privacy, we do not collect:
* Names or email addresses
* IP addresses or device identifiers
* Usage analytics or gameplay data
* Biometric identifiers
Your activity within the App remains entirely on your device.

3. Personal Information
We do not require user accounts, nor do we request, collect, or store any personally identifiable information (PII).

4. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When changes are made, we will revise the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page.
