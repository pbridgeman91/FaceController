This Privacy Policy describes how FaceController ("we", "our", or "the App") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy. We do not collect, store, or share your personal information or facial data.

1. Face Data (TrueDepth API)

FaceController uses the device's TrueDepth camera system (via ARKit/AVFoundation) to track your head and face movements. This allows you to control the mouse cursor and perform game actions using gestures (e.g., aiming with your head, clicking with facial expressions).

To comply with Apple's data privacy guidelines, we explicitly declare the following regarding Face Data:

Data Collected: The App analyzes depth data and facial mapping information from the TrueDepth camera in real-time.

Purpose of Collection: This data is used solely to translate your physical head movements and facial expressions into input commands (e.g., moving a cursor or pressing a virtual button) for gameplay control.

Data Storage: Face data is processed locally on your device in real-time. We do not store, save, or record your face data, depth data, or any facial mapping information.

Data Sharing: We do not share, sell, or transfer face data to any third parties, including advertising platforms or analytics services. The data never leaves your device.

2. Data Collection by Third Parties (Google AdMob)

While the developer of FaceController does not collect your personal data, the App uses Google AdMob, a third-party advertising service, to display ads. Google AdMob may collect and use certain data to serve personalized ads and prevent fraud.

Data Collected by AdMob: This may include your Device ID (such as the Identifier for Advertisers or IDFA), IP address, device model, operating system version, and general usage data.

Purpose: To serve relevant advertisements, perform analytics on ad performance, and ensure security.

Opt-Out: You can control personalized advertising by adjusting your device settings (Settings > Privacy > Tracking on iOS).

For more information, please review Google’s Privacy Policy:

3. Personal Information

We do not knowingly collect, use, or store any personal identification information (such as your name, email address, or phone number).

4. Children’s Privacy

FaceController does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can remove it.

5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Effective Date."
